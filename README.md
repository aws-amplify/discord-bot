# AWS Amplify Discord Bot: "hey-amplify"

This repository contains the source code for the [AWS Amplify Discord Server](https://discord.gg/8RFCGKMfVM)'s bot!

  - thread data is tracked by title, original poster ID, and whether the thread is solved (`GET /api/questions`)
- command: `/giverole` - accepts a ROLE and USER argument to grant a role (NOTE: this command is disabled by default for `@everyone`)
- command: `/contribute` - accepts an Amplify project argument and returns the GitHub contribution URL
- command: `/github` - accepts an Amplify project argument and returns the GitHub repository URL
- command: `/thread` - command suite for thread owners
  - `/thread rename <title>` - allows thread owners to rename their threads
  - `/thread archive` - allows thread owners to optionally archive their thread
  - `/thread solved` - allows thread owners to mark their question (thread) as "solved", which changes prepended `?` with ✅
  - `/thread reopen` - allows thread owners to "reopen" their question (thread), which changes prepended ✅ with `?`
